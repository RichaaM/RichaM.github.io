Argus-1 is a technology demonstration mission for a low-cost and efficient Visual Orbit Determination (OD) system, aimed at solving the lost-in-space problem for small satellites, with an anticipated launch in Fall 2025. The project is led by PI Prof. Zachary Manchester and Prof. Brandon Lucia at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

The payload includes four cameras and an NVIDIA Jetson, where neural network-based region classifiers and landmark detectors identify salient locations from Earth images (as directional vectors). These are then processed by optimization-based algorithms to determine the satelliteâ€™s orbit.

As project manager and engineering lead, I oversee team development across hardware and flight software, driving both requirements and schedule. I am also a key contributor, effectively owning the ADCS, C&DH, Communications (software), and Payload subsystems.
