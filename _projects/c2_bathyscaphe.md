In my freshman year, we were challenged to build a purely mechanical (no electronics) self-contained diving apparatus that could reach any depth and come back at will. We tested our prototype at Nemo33, the deepest indoor swimming pool in the world at the time (2019-2020). Our prototype was configurable and was the most accurate across all teams  (~0.2m error).

Successful test
