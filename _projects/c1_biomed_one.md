In the second-year of my undergraduate studies, I led a small team to design to build a whole monitoring infrastructure to alert emergency health services when a patient is undergoing complications during a person's quarantine and pushed to take it further as a fully-fledge <em>product</em>, BiomedOne. Our solution included: 
- A full data acquisition system for the main COVID symptoms: temperature, heart-rate, and blood oxygen level (SpO2). We also monitored battery level and Wi-Fi strength. The embedded software declined itself in two versions for periodic and continuous (in case of emergency) monitoring
- A capable oboard power management, helping the device lasts for a full quarantine period of 14 days (periodic mode)
- An email-based remote monitoring software deployed on a server (24/7) and interacting with our database
- An accurate simulator of the symptoms to test the whole infrastructure
- Local website as user interface to configure the device
- Custom designed and built armband, adaptable to all arm sizes (for normal humans)
- Medical compliance
- Detailed user manual with usage, configuration, charging, and cleaning instructions
- RGPD compliance and data encryption
