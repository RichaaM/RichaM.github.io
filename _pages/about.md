Hi! I'm a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering - Research program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).As a member of the Robomechanics Lab, advised by Prof. Aaron Johnson, my research focuses on advancing the mobility of wheeled robots in challenging and dynamic environments, such as rough terrains, steps, and vegetation. 

Through classes such as Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning, Planning and Decision Making for Robotics, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), I have gained experiences in developting control algorithms, motion planning techniques, and sensor fusion systems. They have allowed me to explore the practical implementation of robotic concepts, bridging the gap between theory and the real world.

My interests lie at the intersection of Robotics, Controls, and Autonomous Systems, with a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address real-world challenges.
