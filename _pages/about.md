Hi! I'm a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering - Research program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a [Belgian American Educational Foundation](https://baef.be/) Scholar, and a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/). <span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for full-time roles in Aerospace (GNC), Robotics or any other interesting opportunities, so definitely reach out!</span>

Advised by Pr. [Zac Manchester](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/) and Pr. [Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/), my current research focuses on real-time optimization-based planning, control, and navigation for agile robots and autonomous spacecraft. I also actively work on the system design, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), flight software, and communication subsystems for our CubeSat missions (Py4, Argus-1, Argus-2).

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Electromechanical Engineering from [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en) (Belgium) in 2022. My undergraduate research was centered on the development, experimental testing, and control of new sensors and actuators for minimally invasive endoscopic and surgical tools, and on local model-order reduction optimization for spacecraft reentry simulation.

I have interned at [Space Applications Services](https://www.spaceapplications.com/) as an Avionics and Embedded Systems Engineer Intern, primarily working on Ground Support Equipment (GSE) for payload development and testing, and at [Redwire Space](https://redwirespace.com/), as a Mechanical Engineer Intern, contributing to on-orbit space servicing systems.

My interests encompass everything that moves: real-time trajectory optimization, motion planning, control, navigation, and leveraging deep learning for **high-performance autonomous systems**, on Earth and beyond.
